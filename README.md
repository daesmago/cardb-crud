## Setup
1. Restore the MySQL database with the backup provided in the folder "sql_backup".
2. Initialize the project's backend in an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or NetBeans through the pom.xml found in the folder "server". Wait until all the plugins and dependencies are downloaded.
3. Run the application, this will deploy the backend in the url: "http://localhost:8080".
4. Initialize the project's frontend in VS Code or an IDE like WebStorm, making sure you are inside the folder "client", using the next script:
```
$ npm start
```
5. You can now use the application, go to the url: "http://localhost:3000"
